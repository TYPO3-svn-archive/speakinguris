Summary of changes from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0
============================================

Jan Roerich <jan.roehrich@iao.fhg.de>:
  o Introduced this changelog
  o different subtrees with same title configurations are 
     now handled correctly
  o HTTP_HOST var is now used to detect the target domain
     (more than one root-page is possible), but link building 
     doesn't work yet in this case
  o All configuration options changed from "speakingURLs" do "speakingURIs"
  o now inter-domain linking works if Domain records are only on the level of root-pages
